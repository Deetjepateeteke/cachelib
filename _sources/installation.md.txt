# Installation

Run this to download cachelib and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deetjepateeteke/cachelib.git
cd cachelib
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The dependencies defined in `requirements.txt` are only used for developing purposes. So it isn't necessary to install them if you are using cachelib in your own project.
